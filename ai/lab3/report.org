* Animal classification decision tree
** Part A
   To generate the type selection decision tree I used the J48 algorithm.

   [secreen capture]

   A textual form of the tree is easier to manipulate.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   feathers = false
   |   milk = false
   |   |   backbone = false
   |   |   |   airborne = false
   |   |   |   |   predator = false
   |   |   |   |   |   legs <= 2: invertebrate (2.0)
   |   |   |   |   |   legs > 2: insect (2.0)
   |   |   |   |   predator = true: invertebrate (8.0)
   |   |   |   airborne = true: insect (6.0)
   |   |   backbone = true
   |   |   |   fins = false
   |   |   |   |   tail = false: amphibian (3.0)
   |   |   |   |   tail = true: reptile (6.0/1.0)
   |   |   |   fins = true: fish (13.0)
   |   milk = true: mammal (41.0)
   feathers = true: bird (20.0)

   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Then save all of the attributes in a file called attributes.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   animal
   hair
   feathers
   eggs
   milk
   airborne
   aquatic
   predator
   toothed
   backbone
   breathes
   venomous
   fins
   legs
   tail
   domestic
   catsize
   type
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Then run we run

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ cat tree | sed 's/[\t |]*\([^ \t]*\) [=<>].*/\1/' | sort | uniq | cat attributes - | sort | uniq -u
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   What this does basically is it extracts the attributes from the
   textual tree using =sed=, then it cuts out the duplicate lines
   with =sort | uniq= then appends the attributes to stdout from the
   =attributes= file and sorts the lines. Now we know the attributes
   we have used are the ones that are double so we =uniq -u= to leave
   them out. The result is:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   animal
   aquatic
   breathes
   catsize
   domestic
   eggs
   hair
   toothed
   type
   venomous
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Ignore those (except =type=) in weka and as expected the tree is
   unchanged.

** Part B
   We use the BayesNet algorithm. Attempting to extract the figure we
   notice weka exports erronous dot code. Nothing too serious, just
   remove dots and dashes from graph and node names. Long story short
   this is what we come up with.
